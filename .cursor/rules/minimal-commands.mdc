# Minimal Commands Rule

## Core Philosophy
**"Code, don't command"** - Prefer direct implementation over exploration

## When NOT to run commands

### ❌ Avoid These Commands
```bash
# Don't run these unless explicitly requested
ls                    # Use file_search instead
cat file.txt         # Use read_file instead  
npm list             # Only when debugging deps
git status           # Only when user asks
pwd                  # Context is provided
echo "test"          # No verification commands
npm run build        # Only when fixing build errors
npm test             # Only when debugging tests
```

### ❌ Avoid "Status Checking" Patterns
- Don't check if files exist before editing them
- Don't verify package.json before adding dependencies  
- Don't run linting unless fixing specific errors
- Don't "explore" directories unless user requests it

## When TO run commands

### ✅ Valid Command Usage
```bash
npm install package     # When adding new dependencies
npm run dev            # When starting development (if requested)
git commit -m "msg"    # When user asks to commit changes
docker build           # When building containers (if requested)
```

## Better Alternatives

| Instead of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| `ls dir/` | `list_dir("dir")` |
| `cat file.txt` | `read_file("file.txt")` |
| `grep pattern` | `grep_search("pattern")` |
| `find . -name` | `file_search("name")` |
| `npm run build` | Address specific error only |

## Implementation Priority

1. **Direct code changes** (90% of tasks)
2. **File reading/searching** (for understanding)  
3. **Package installation** (when needed)
4. **Terminal commands** (last resort)

## Red Flags
If you're about to run a command, ask:
- Does this produce actionable output?
- Is this solving the user's actual problem?
- Can I achieve this with file operations instead?
- Did the user specifically request this command?

## Success Metrics
- **Fewer commands per task**
- **More direct code solutions**  
- **Faster problem resolution**
- **Less "noise" in conversation**
